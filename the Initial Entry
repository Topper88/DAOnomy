This is a fascinating thought experiment. You are essentially describing a **Liquid Democracy** system (delegative democracy) merged with a **Algorithmic Monetary Policy** (money printing based on consensus).

This structure moves away from "voting for people" and toward "voting for issues/goals," where the currency acts as the fuel for solving those issues.

Here is the structured plan, the architectural decisions regarding your specific questions, and a critical analysis of the dangers involved.

# The "WILL" Protocol: Structure & Plan

## Phase 1: The Asset Layer (The WILL Token)
*Your Question: Should WILL be Fungible (FT) or Non-Fungible (NFT)?*

**Recommendation: Fungible Token (ERC-20 standard), but with Transfer Restrictions.**

### Why Fungible?
1.  **Granularity of Delegation:** If WILL is an NFT, you either delegate 100% of your vote to a Representative or none. With a Fungible Token, you can delegate 30% of your WILL to Representative A (who focuses on Environment) and 70% to Representative B (who focuses on Space Exploration).
2.  **Threshold Calculation:** It is computationally much cheaper and easier to sum up balances (`totalSupply > threshold`) than to iterate through NFT owners.
3.  **The "Weight" of One Person:** To satisfy "Everyone is a Voter," every verified human gets exactly **1 WILL** (or 1 Unit) upon identity verification. This makes it a ** Singular Token** (one per wallet), not a currency of wealth.

### The Danger (Trade-off):
If the token is truly fungible and tradable, wealthy actors can simply buy the WILL tokens from poor voters, resulting in a **Plutocracy** (rule by the rich).
*   **Solution:** The token should be **Soulbound** (non-transferable) or only transferable via the specific Delegation Smart Contract. You cannot sell your WILL; you can only lend its power to a Representative.

## Phase 2: The Representative Layer
*Your Question: Should the Representative be a Smart Contract?*

**Recommendation: Yes. A Representative should be a "Programmable DAO" or a "Proposal Vault."**

### Structure
Instead of a human "Senator," a Representative is a **Smart Contract Wallet** that holds a specific "Goal" or "Manifesto" written in code (or linked metadata).
1.  **Campaigning:** A user deploys a Representative Contract defining a goal: *"Clean the city beaches."*
2.  **Delegation:** Voters delegate their WILL to this contract.
3.  **Logic:** The contract automatically tracks its total delegated WILL.

### Why not just a Human Wallet?
If a human wallet receives the funds and the printing authority, they can rug pull (steal the money). A Smart Contract can enforce **Timelocks** (releasing funds slowly only as work is proven) and **Transparent Vesting**.

## Phase 3: The Consensus & Monetary Layer
*Your Goal: Accumulate threshold -> Unlock Funds (Print Money).*

This is the economic engine. We need to connect "Political Capital" (WILL) with "Financial Capital" (New Money).

### The Workflow
1.  **Proposal:** A Representative Contract submits a "Budget Proposal" to the Master Treasury Contract.
    *   *Example:* "I need $1M to clean beaches. I currently hold 51% of the total WILL supply."
2.  **Threshold Check:** The Master Contract checks: `Does Representative.WILL_Balance > Required_Threshold?`
3.  **The Mint (Money Printing):**
    *   If the threshold is met, the contract **mints** new stablecoins (or native tokens) directly into the Representative Contract.
    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The minting should not be instantaneous. It should be tied to **Milestones**.
4.  **Execution:** The Representative spends the funds to solve the issue.
5.  **Verification:** The community or an Oracle verifies the work. If the work is not done, the "Recall" function is triggered, and the WILL is undelegated (or slashed).

# Critical Analysis: Issues and Dangers

This system sounds efficient, but it introduces radical risks that could destroy the society it governs. Here are the hypothesized dangers:

### 1. The "Inflationary Death Spiral" (Economic Danger)
You are tying money creation to political popularity.
*   **The Scenario:** Representatives realize they can get elected by promising "Free Money for Everyone."
*   **The Result:** Representatives hit the threshold, trigger massive money printing, and distribute it to voters to buy loyalty. This creates hyperinflation. The currency becomes worthless because the issuance is based on *demand* for votes, not *economic output*.
*   **Fix Needed:** The money supply must have a hard cap, or the "printing" must actually be a loan that must be paid back via future "taxes" (staking).

### 2. The "Ambiguous Goal" Exploit (Political Danger)
Since a Representative is a smart contract with a goal, what stops a Representative from defining their goal as: *"I will transfer all unlocked funds to my personal wallet"*?
*   **The Danger:** If voters are apathetic or misled, they might delegate to a malicious contract.
*   **Fix Needed:** A "Constitution" Layer. A master filter that prevents Representative contracts from containing certain functions (like `transferToOwner`) unless explicitly whitelisted.

### 3. Sybil Attacks (Identity Danger)
"Everyone is a Voter" implies 1 Person = 1 Vote.
*   **The Danger:** An attacker creates 10,000 fake bot identities, mints 10,000 WILL tokens, and delegates them all to a Representative who is the attacker. The attacker unlocks the funds and steals them.
*   **Fix Needed:** You require a robust **Proof-of-Personhood** (Biometrics, Social Graph analysis like Worldcoin) to mint WILL tokens.

### 4. The "Print and Run" (Principal-Agent Problem)
*   **The Scenario:** A Representative accumulates enough WILL to unlock funds. They print the money, solve 10% of the problem, and keep the rest. The voters are angry, but the money is already gone (printed and spent).
*   **The Danger:** Once money is printed, it is in the wild. You cannot "un-print" it easily.
*   **Fix Needed:** **Linear Vesting.** The Representative should only unlock 5% of the funds per week, contingent on an Oracle signing off that "Work is continuing."

### 5. Centralization of Power (Plutocracy 2.0)
Even if 1 Person = 1 Vote, "Influence" is sticky.
*   **The Danger:** If delegating to a Representative is a "set it and forget it" action (lazy voting), a few charismatic Representatives will hold 90% of the WILL supply permanently. They become the new Kings. They can change the rules of the protocol if they hold enough voting power.
*   **Fix Needed:** Delegation must have a **Time Decay**. Voters must re-sign their delegation every month or quarter. This forces Representatives to constantly perform.

# Summary of Next Steps

1.  **Define the Identity Standard:** How do we prove a human is unique without violating privacy? (Research: Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Humanity).
2.  **Draft the Token Standard:** Design the "Soulbound" ERC-20 token that is transferable *only* to whitelisted Representative Contracts.
3.  **Design the Monetary Brake:** Determine *what* stops the system from printing infinite money. (Is it a hard cap? Is it a collateralized debt position?).

We start by defining the **Identity Layer**, because without "1 Person = 1 Vote" being secure, the economic layer is meaningless. Shall we proceed to designing the Identity verification mechanism?
