This is a fascinating architectural challenge. You are essentially describing a **Liquid Democracy** model powered by a **Tokenized Proof-of-Stake** governance system.

By tying currency issuance (inflation) directly to the democratic "unlocking" of goals, you are creating a system where money is backed by **social intent** rather than gold or debt.

Here is a proposed structure for this system, addressing your specific questions on token standards and technical implementation.

## 1. The Token Architecture

To make this work, we need to distinguish between **Identity** (who you are) and **Influence** (what you want).

### The WILL Token: Non-Fungible (NFT) with Fungible Credits

* **The Recommendation:** The core WILL token should be a **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** linked to a verified identity (Soulbound Token).
* **Why?** If WILL were fungible, wealthy individuals could simply buy up other people's "Will," leading to plutocracy. An NFT ensures **one person, one base vote.**
* **The "Power" Mechanic:** While the WILL token itself is an NFT, it could generate "Voting Power" (fungible credits) over time, which the holder then delegates.

### The Representative: Smart Contract (DAO)

* **The Recommendation:** Yes, Representatives should be **Smart Contracts (specifically, Governor Contracts).**
* **Why?** A human representative can break promises. A Smart Contract "Representative" is a transparent vault. It defines exactly what will happen with the funds once the threshold is met, ensuring the "Will" is executed as programmed.

## 2. The Economic Lifecycle: "Proof of Intent"

1. **Delegation:** Voters stake their WILL (NFT) or stream their Voting Power to a specific Representative Smart Contract that aligns with a goal (e.g., "Build a High-Speed Rail").
2. **Threshold & Minting:** Once the contract reaches a predefined threshold of WILL (e.g., 10% of the total population), the system triggers a **Mint Event**.
3. **Liquidity Injection:** New fungible tokens (the currency) are minted directly into that contract. This is "Goal-Based Inflation."
4. **Execution:** The funds are released to verified contractors or milestones defined in the contract.

## 3. Risks and Dangers

While innovative, this "Minting by Popularity" model carries significant systemic risks:

* **Hyper-Inflationary Loops:** If voters approve too many "popular" goals simultaneously (e.g., free housing, free energy, and new roads all at once), the massive influx of new tokens will devalue the currency, leading to hyperinflation.
* **The "Populist" Vulnerability:** Representatives might propose "goals" that are popular but economically disastrous. A goal like "Give everyone 1,000 tokens today" would easily hit a threshold but destroy the economy's purchasing power.
* **Sybil Attacks & Identity:** If the WILL NFT isn't tied to a robust, biometrically verified "Proof of Personhood," one person could create 1,000 accounts to mint unlimited money for their own "goals."
* **The Minority Neglect:** Small but vital infrastructure needs (like sewage repair in a small town) may never hit the global threshold because they lack the "viral" appeal of larger projects.

## 4. How to Proceed: The Roadmap

To build this out, we should tackle the design in these phases:

* **Phase A: Identity Layer.** How do we issue the WILL NFT so it cannot be traded or stolen?
* **Phase B: Monetary Policy.** What are the "Guardrails"? (e.g., a maximum inflation cap per year, regardless of how many goals hit their threshold).
* **Phase C: The "Un-Minting" (Sinks).** How does money leave the system? To prevent infinite inflation, we need a "Tax" or "Burn" mechanic when goals are completed.

**Would you like to start by defining the "Identity Layer" and how we ensure one WILL token per human, or should we dive into the "Monetary Guardrails" to prevent hyperinflation?**
